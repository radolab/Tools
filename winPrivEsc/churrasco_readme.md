This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000
, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008.

(Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09â€“012 )

This security update resolves four publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities
 could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker is allowed to log on to the system and then run a specially
 crafted application. The attacker must be able to run code on the local machine in order to exploit this
 vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete
 control over the affected system.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, 
Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. For more information, 
see the subsection, Affected and Non-Affected Software, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that Microsoft Windows addresses 
tokens requested by the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC), and by properly isolating 
WMI providers and processes that run under the NetworkService or LocalService accounts. For more information
about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability
entry under the next section, Vulnerability Information.
